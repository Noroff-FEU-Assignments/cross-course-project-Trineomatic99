    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[First, I would tell them not to click on any suspicious links, keep strong passwords and to use a website firewall. Then it would be to secure authorization and authentication, use a trusted and tested third party application. Use good tools as CI/CD to reject changes that do not pass the checks before saving it in the codebase. Make sure that the network is secure.]</p>
